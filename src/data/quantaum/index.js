# Quantaum Physics

Over the last decades, highly specialized and accurate discretization schemes have been developed to solve fundamental model equations such as the 
Navier-Stokes, Maxwell’s, or Schroedinger’s equations. Seemingly trivial changes to the discretization can determine whether key phenomena are visible 
in the solutions or not. Rather than discarding the powerful methods that have been developed in the field of numerical mathematics, I want to show 
that it is highly beneficial to use them as much as possible when applying Deep Learning.
